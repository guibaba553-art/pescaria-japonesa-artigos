## When to use

Use this skill in two modes:

### 1. Integration Mode
When the user wants to **write code** to integrate AbacatePay into an application (TypeScript / Go). Use the rules, examples, and best practices below.

### 2. Agent Mode (Direct API)
When the user wants to **perform actions directly** — list customers, create checkouts, check balance, query MRR, etc. Execute the API via `curl` in the terminal. See [rules/agent.md](rules/agent.md) for all endpoints and templates.

## How to use

> **📦 Reference files included locally:** All rules, examples, tools, tests, and utilities from the AbacatePay skills repository are available locally in this skill directory. Relative links below resolve to these local files.

For **direct API usage** (agent mode), see:
- [rules/agent.md](rules/agent.md) - Execute API calls directly via curl (list customers, create checkouts, check balance, etc.)

## Visual Documentation

### Checkout Flow Diagram
Use Mermaid or similar tools to visualize the checkout process:

```
graph TD
    A[User Initiates Checkout] --> B[Create Checkout Request]
    B --> C[Abacatepay API Processes]
    C --> D[Return Checkout URL]
    D --> E[User Completes Payment]
    E --> F[Webhook Notification]
    F --> G[Application Handles Event]
```

### Webhook Flow Diagram
```
graph TD
    A[Event Occurs in Abacatepay] --> B[Webhook Sent to Endpoint]
    B --> C[Verify Signature]
    C --> D{Valid?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Process Event]
    D -->|No| F[Reject Request]
    E --> G[Respond with 200]
    F --> H[Respond with 401]
```

Suggested tools: Mermaid (integrates with Markdown), Draw.io, or Lucidchart for creating diagrams.
